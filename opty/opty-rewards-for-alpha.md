The OPTY APY displayed in the app during Alpha will be indicative and dependent on the USD value of OPTY tokens once they are live and trading in the market as well as your individual vault balance and the total value locked in the vault.

You can adjust the slider according to your expectation of what the OPTY price will be to get an estimated OPTY rewards APY.
