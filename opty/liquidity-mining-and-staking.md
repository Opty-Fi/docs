# Liquidity Mining and Staking

To incentivize users into depositing and retaining assets with OptyFi, the liquidity mining program will distribute OPTY tokens to OptyFi vaults, further providing vault depositors with enhanced returns. 

OPTY holders will be incentivized to stake OPTY into staking pools in order to earn more OPTY. There will be multiple staking pools featuring different "lock-in" periods. Pools with longer lock-in periods will return a higher rate of return on deposited OPTY than pools with shorter lock-in periods.

Additionally, as the OptyFi Protocol and community grows, new liquidity mining and staking mechanisms might be introduced.
