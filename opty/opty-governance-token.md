# OPTY Governance Token

OPTY is the governance token for the OptyFi Protocol and OptyFi DAO. It derives fundamental value by entitling holders to ownership of the Protocol and participation in the governance of the DAO.

The value of the OptyFi Protocol, and therefore the OPTY token, will be increased in the following ways:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Users**](../protocol/participants.md#yield-users) deposit assets into OptyFi vaults, increasing the Protocol’s asset base and revenues. Increased assets improve economic efficiency and therefore Protocol profitability.
2. \*\*\*\*[**Builders**](../protocol/participants.md#builders) ****\(contributors\) enhance OptyFi by improving the Protocol's utility to users \(attracting more users and assets\) and increasing the Protocol's ability to generate above market returns. This results in increased revenues and profitability for the Protocol.

In a self-reinforcing cycle, the OPTY token is used as an incentivization mechanism for users and contributors. As users and contributors increase the Protocol’s value, they become its owners and accrue the benefits of the value they have helped create.
