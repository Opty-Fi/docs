# Vault Guides

Vaults are going to be the most used feature of the OptyFi Protocol.

In the following pages we introduce and explain the main interactions you are likely to have with OptyFi Vaults including [Depositing Assets](deposit-assets.md), [Withdrawing Assets](withdraw-assets.md), [Claiming OPTY](claim-opty.md), and [Staking OPTY](stake-opty.md).

Enjoy.
