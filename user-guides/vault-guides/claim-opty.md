# Claim OPTY

The OptyFi Protocol incentives users to invest in vaults and build up the Protocol's value by rewarding them in native OPTY governance tokens.

To claim your OPTY token rewards, you need to navigate to the "Vaults" page, select a vault, click "Claim", and then confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Alternatively, you could also claim and automatically stake your OPTY tokens in a single transaction by clicking "Claim and Stake".
