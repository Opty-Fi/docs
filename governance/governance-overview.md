# Governance Overview

The OptyFi Protocol is a decentralized system owned and governed by the [OptyFi DAO](optyfi-dao.md), whose members are the community of [OPTY](../opty/opty-governance-token.md) token holders. All major decisions regarding the Protocol are made by the governance through a [voting process](voting.md#voting-process). The governance may elect to delegate the implementation of decisions and operational duties, and has the right to select/remove [Operators](operators.md) for this purpose.
