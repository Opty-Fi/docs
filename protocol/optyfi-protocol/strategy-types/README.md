# Strategy Types

The OptyFi Protocol defines two major types of strategies for vaults: [Investment Strategies ](./#investment-strategies)and [Reward Strategies](./#reward-strategies).

## Investment Strategies

OptyFi vault assets are deposited into DeFi liquidity pools in order to generate yield based on predefined investment strategies. These strategies may be single-step or multi-step and may include a borrow step. 

Diagrams and examples of Investment Strategies can be found [here](investment-strategies.md). 

## Reward Strategies

By undertaking certain investment strategies, OptyFi's vaults may earn reward tokens \(such as COMP for Compound or CRV for Curve\). 

The vault reward strategies determine how much of these reward tokens will be converted back to the vault's underlying assets \(after being claimed from the reward protocols\) and how much will be send to the reward vaults.

Diagrams and examples of Reward Strategies can be found [here](reward-strategies.md).
