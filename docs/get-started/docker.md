  data as well as persistence.

QuestDB has images for both Linux/macOS and Windows on
[Docker Hub]({@dockerUrl@}).

## Install Docker

Before we start, you will need to install Docker. You can find guides for your
platform on the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## QuestDB image

Once Docker is installed, you will need to pull QuestDB's image from
[Docker Hub]({@dockerUrl@}) and create a container. You can do both in one
command using `docker run`:

```shell
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8812:8812 questdb/questdb
```

### Options

| Argument | Description                 |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| `-p`     | Port to publish to the host |
| `-v`     | To bind mount a volume      |

#### `-p` parameter

This parameter will publish a port to the host, you can specify:

- `-p 9000:9000`: [REST API](/docs/reference/api/rest/) and
  [Web Console](/docs/reference/client/web-console/)
- `-p 8812:8812`: [Postgres](/docs/reference/api/postgres/)
- `-p 9009:9009`: [InfluxDB line protocol](/docs/reference/api/influxdb/)

#### -v volumes

The QuestDB [root_directory](/docs/concept/root-directory-structure/) will be in
the following location:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"

<Tabs defaultValue="linux" values={[
  { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
  { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
]}>


<TabItem value="linux">


```shell
/root/.questdb/db
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="windows">


```shell
C:\questdb\db
```

</TabItem>


</Tabs>


## Container status

You can check the status of your container with **docker ps**. It also lists the
ports we published:

```shell
docker ps
```

```shell title="Result"
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
dd363939f261        questdb/questdb     "/app/bin/java -m io…"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        8812/tcp, 9000/tcp   frosty_gauss
```

## Importing data and sending queries

Now that QuestDB is running, you can start interacting with it:

- If you published the port `9000`, you can follow our
  [REST](/docs/reference/api/rest/) page
- If you published the port `8812`, follow our
  [Postgres](/docs/reference/api/postgres/) page
- If you published the port `9009`, follow our
  [InfluxDB](/docs/reference/api/influxdb/) page

## Data persistence

### Restart an existing container

When you stop the container, it will not be removed by Docker. This means that
you can restart it anytime and your data will be accessible:

```shell title="Start container from the  ID obtained with 'docker ps'"
docker start dd363939f261
```

### Re-run `docker run`

If you re-run the command:

```shell
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8812:8812 questdb/questdb
```

A new container will be created for the QuestDB image. This means that the
container will be fresh, any data you may have created previously won't be
accessible.
