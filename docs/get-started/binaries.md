This guide shows how to install and use QuestDB from the binaries.

QuestDB comes with a script `questdb.sh` for Linux/FreeBSD and an executable
`questdb.exe` for Windows. If you are looking for macOS, please check our
[Homebrew](/docs/get-started/homebrew/) section.

## Download

You can find the latest binaries on the [Get QuestDB](/get-questdb/) page. The
release notes are on our [GitHub release]({@githubUrl@}/releases) page.

## Prerequisites

### "Any (no JVM)" version

The file is named:

```shell
questdb-{@version@}-no-jre-bin.tar.gz
```

This binary is around or less than 4MB.

#### Java 11

When using this binary you will need to have Java 11 installed locally. You can
check which version is already installed on your system with:

```shell
java -version
```

If you do not already have Java installed, download and install the package for
your operating system. We support:

- AdoptOpenJDK
- Amazon Corretto
- OpenJDK
- Oracle Java

Other Java distributions are most likely working but we are not running tests on
them.

#### `JAVA_HOME`

The environment variable `JAVA_HOME` needs to be set to your JDK's installation
folder.

### Your operating system version

The file is named:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"

<Tabs defaultValue="linux" values={[
  { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
  { label: "FreeBSD", value: "bsd" },
  { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
]}>


<TabItem value="linux">


```shell
questdb-{@version@}-rt-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="bsd">


```shell
questdb-{@version@}-rt-freebsd-amd64.tar.gz
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="windows">


```shell
questdb-{@version@}-rt-windows-amd64.tar.gz
```

</TabItem>


</Tabs>


This binary weights around 20MB, this depends on your operating system.

When using this binary, you do not need anything on your machine, the Java
runtime is packaged directly with QuestDB.
