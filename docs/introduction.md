Idle is a decentralized protocol dedicated to bringing automatic asset allocation and aggregation to the interest-bearing tokens economy. This protocol bundles stable crypto-assets (stablecoins) into tokenized baskets that are programmed to automatically rebalance based on different management logics.

The Idle Protocol employs a strategy-token system. Every allocation strategy has is own set of tokens that represent a pool of yield-generating assets spread across different DeFi protocols. These tokens represent the investorâ€™s proportional ownership of the whole pool and the interest accrued over time. This issuing method is similar to traditional mutual funds shares structure, and it allows Idle to be non-custodial.

Currently, Idle uses two different allocation strategies:

* **Best-Yield:** this strategy combines multiple money markets to automatically provide the highest interest rates, beating the best traditional offerings across interest-bearing tokens and DeFi protocols.
* **Risk-Adjusted:** this strategy automatically changes the asset allocation in order to find the optimal mix between risk scores and yield.
