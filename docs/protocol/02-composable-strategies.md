## Composable Strategies

The OptyFi Protocol proposes a composable model for DeFi yield strategies by:

1. Abstracting the core building blocks of DeFi (e.g. pools and vaults, underlying and pool tokens, yield and rewards) 
2. Defining a yield strategy as sequence of (serial or parallel) deposit and/or borrow steps involving DeFi pools
3. Providing a flexible, on-chain, multi-step yield strategy execution engine capable of performing any such yield strategy  
4. Delivering an open-source statistical/ML algorithm that attempts to predict the optimal yield strategy for each DeFi asset and risk tolerance level at a given point in time.
