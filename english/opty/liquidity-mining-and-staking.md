# Liquidity Mining and Staking

To incentivize users to deposit and retain assets with OptyFi, the liquidity mining program will distribute OPTY tokens to OptyFi vaults, providing vault depositors with enhanced returns. 

OPTY holders will be incentivized to stake OPTY into staking pools in order to earn more OPTY. There will be multiple staking pools each with a different "lock-in" period. Users who deposit into pools with longer lock-in periods, will receive a higher rate of return on their OPTY.

Additionally, as the OptyFi Protocol and community grows, new liquidity mining and staking mechanisms might be introduced.
