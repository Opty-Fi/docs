# Voting

## Voting Process

Governance will participate in decision making through a proposal voting process. The general proposal process will be as follows:

1. **Discussions**: The community may carry on discussions in the OptyFi Forums, including in the “Possible Proposals” section.
2. **"OIP" Proposal Creation**: If a particular discussion attracts significant interest, the Operator may create a formal OptyFi Improvement Proposal \(OIP\).
3. **OPTY Staking**: In order to participate in voting, OPTY holders will need to stake their OPTY. The length of time for which OPTY tokens are locked in the staking pools, will determine the [voting power](voting.md#voting-power) of the OPTY. 
4. **Voting**: Each OIP will be set to a Governance vote. Voting rules will be determined by the [proposal category](voting.md#issues-by-proposal-category).
